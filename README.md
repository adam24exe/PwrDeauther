# PwrDeauther (V. 2.0)
PwrDeauther is an automatic deauthentication script that uses MDK3. MDK3 offers greater power than Aireplay. This script empowers users to deauthenticate either a specific SSID (Option 1) or an entire channel (Option 2).

## Notes
Certain IntelÂ® hardware, particularly Centrino, may encounter issues due to the operation of MDK3. From the MDK3 documentation:

`MDK3 uses the drivers and Injection routines from this project and its predecessor. Thus, all drivers listed there should work with MDK3. (Some special hardware, like Intel Centrino (ipw2200) is NOT supported since they can only inject data, and no management information!)`
